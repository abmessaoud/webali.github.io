Hello, I am Ali and I am a software engineer. I use and therefore will write about Java & Kotlin as backend technologies and I do like to get hands dirty with frontend technologies. The topics I will be writing about will cover microservices, the web, AI, and blockchain. I will additionally draft about my projects and my ideas that someone will be inspired and build them when I don’t have the time, skills, or money to pull them off. The ultimate aim of this blog is to make my little bit of the word and to share the working, tested solutions to various challenges I have found along the way.

You may be wondering what experience I have. I started my career as a freelance developer building websites and apps for small businesses in Kairouan, Tunisia. Later I moved to France and started my career as a Software engineer in Paris. I worked for CEA Tech and Sopra HR Software as Software Engineer and since 2018 I have joined Arolla where I can work on several projects with several companies and teams.

Most of my knowledge comes from reading books, blogs, moocs, meetups, open source projects and learning from those I’ve worked with at the time.

Some non-programming things to know about me. I live in Paris area, I am a coffee snob, and love football.

Write me on ![](./images/mail.JPG)!
